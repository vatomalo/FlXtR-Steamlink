 * colour conversion), which was that pump period and not a firmware cost.
 * Spend a bounded slice sleeping instead, so one browser frame can carry more

 *
 * The worker now outranks this thread (see psp_threads.h), so
 * this is no longer the only CPU the worker gets and no longer a yield it
 * depends on. What it still buys is the look: a job that finishes during the
 * sleep is collected inside this pump unit rather than at the next one, and
 * the unit after it is the one that submits.
 *
 * And no longer than that look needs to be. Four milliseconds was one wait,
 * sized to outlast a whole job. Inside a dead-time window it became the
 * window: the device measured a 4.45ms draw pump completing 0.6 submissions a
 * frame, because a single unit's wait consumed everything the engine's draw
 * had to give. What the pump wants is not a longer sleep but more of them --
 * sleep, look, submit, sleep -- and one sleep of the kernel's own granularity
 * is the smallest useful one there is. The caller's remaining slice bounds it
 * further.

 * three calls: sceMpegGetAvcNalAu, sceMpegAvcDecode, sceMpegAvcDecodeDetail2.
 * It never flushes, never re-inits the access unit, and never touches the
 * decoder on a seek at all -- mp4_play_do_seek repositions the reader and
 * nothing else. sceMpegAvcDecodeFlush does not appear anywhere in that tree.
 * So the two calls our in-place reset makes are precisely the two the reference
 * never makes, and four device runs now put every wedge four to six seconds
 * after one of them while the first prime of a session has never produced one.
 *
 * The scope is the per-stream object and nothing above it. sceMpegDelete and
 * sceMpegCreate destroy and rebuild everything the hypothesis implicates -- the
 * elementary-stream and ringbuffer read/write state, stream registration, the
 * detail and conversion buffers. sceMpegInit and sceMpegFinish manage the
 * library runtime, which the create ladder already treats as process-lifetime
 * (it finishes only when the Media Engine boot type changes), and re-running
 * that pair would also mean re-booting the engine through kuKernelCall from
 * this thread. Left alone deliberately: if a rebuilt object still wedges, the
 * runtime tier is the next thing to try, and it is a separate experiment.
 *
 * Every buffer is reused where it lies. The Media Engine pool is a bump
 * allocator with no per-block free, so re-running the create ladder's
 * allocations would take a second 4 MiB set, exhaust the pool, fall back to the
 * newlib heap above the engine's addressable limit, and fail both codecs on
 * valid input -- the exact defect the pool exists to prevent. mpeg_memory, the
 * DDR arena, the AU object and the parameter sets keep their addresses; the
 * size query below is a check that they still fit, never a reason to allocate.
 *
 * Runs on the codec worker, for the same reason the teardown tail does.

 * Yes, offer the partner now -- inside this same pump visit.
 *
 * The batching mechanism was complete and starved: a device soak measured
 * 1.32 blocks per job against a ceiling of 2, with audio delivery pinned at
 * 26 blocks a second. The reason was upstream of everything the worker does.
 * A pump visit spends a bounded number of packets and shares them with video,
 * so a visit whose first packet went to a video unit had nothing left for the
 * partner, and the staged unit was flushed alone. Pairs only formed when two
 * visits happened to precede a job.
 *
 * This is the backend saying it is holding one and would take another. Three
 * things make it safe to grant, and all three are re-decided here rather than
 * inherited from the decision that staged the first unit:
 *
 *   - It is audio. Video is never deferred and never batched.
 *   - The batch has room, and is not empty. An empty batch has no partner to
 *     pair with, and a full one is already on its way to the worker.
 *   - Video cannot use the decoder right now. This is the same question
 *     psp_media_submit asked before deferring the first unit, asked again
 *     because the answer moves: a slot may have been claimed since, and if it
 *     has, the visit belongs to video and the staged unit goes out alone.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is choose. The pump still selects the earliest access
 * unit across both sources, so a video unit due before the partner is still
 * submitted first; this only ensures the visit has a packet left to do it
 * with. And it never reaches for bytes: a partner the demuxer does not
 * already hold ends the visit on the ordinary would-block path.

 * staged from the staged copy -- psp_media_present_texture_for skips the whole
 * staging branch when the identity has not changed, and the texture it hands
 * back points at the staging, not at the slot. The slot is read exactly once,
 * by the copy itself, inside a borrow lease that is held until the transfer is
 * joined. After that join nothing will ever read it again.

 * the slot for every draw, so their claim genuinely has to outlive the frame,

 * A late call naming a picture the slot has moved past is a reader that lost
 * its race and must not free somebody else's claim.

 * immediately before calling this, so a lease still standing here belongs to
 * something else that is mid-read. It is deliberately not the guard against a
 * DMA transfer that outlived its join -- that transfer no longer holds a lease
 * either, so the caller makes that decision, and psp_media_present_texture_finish

 * slot's psp_media_surface_borrowed. The DMA copy holds that claim until it is
 * joined, and the release this runs behind happens after the join, so an emit
