 * How far past the presentation clock a pump may submit.
 *
 * Fifty milliseconds was three and a half access units of runway: a browser
 * frame that overran had no way to make the deficit up, because the horizon
 * moves with the clock and never lends anything back. Device cycle verdict3
 * shows the consequence -- horizon exits on 71% of playing frames while the
 * Media Engine sat 88% idle (1,336 jobs averaging 3.5 ms across a 40-second
 * session). The engine was never the ceiling; eligibility was.
 *
 * The resource that actually grows with this number is the audio PCM queue,
 * and it is fixed: PSP_MEDIA_AUDIO_QUEUE_SLOTS blocks of
 * PSP_MEDIA_AUDIO_SAMPLES, which at the maximum supported rate is what the
 * static assert below bounds. Nothing is allocated per lead microsecond --
 * every admitted sample still passes through the single bounded packet buffer
 * and becomes the backend's, and the backend answers WOULD_BLOCK when its
 * queue or its one Media Engine job is full. So this only decides what a pump
 * may consider, never how much memory exists, and unit boundedness, the slice
 * and the cancellation checks are untouched.
 *
 * Half a second is the largest value the PCM queue admits and is the same
 * horizon the first-frame preroll already used, which is why that preroll now
 * needs no boost of its own.

 * worker. Even though that worker now outranks the browser, without this look

 * frames, 8.8ms of every 46.4ms frame, which is most of the difference
 * between a 24fps stream playing at 0.9x and the same stream fitting two
 * vertical blanks.
 *
 * The second is the decoded surface. A borrowed video frame stays valid until
 * the next submit (see MediaVideoFrame in tilefinch/media_backend.h), and a
 * video submit can emit a picture the previous decode left pending -- a
 * colour conversion straight into that surface. While the DMA controller is
 * copying the surface into the texture, that is a write into the buffer the
 * copy is reading. The draw pump runs after the copy has been joined and is

 * How many AAC access units one worker job may decode back to back, and why

 * owned 27.9 seconds of it against video's 24.5, over 3,174 audio jobs
 * averaging 8.8ms each -- of which the firmware call is only about 1.1ms.
 * The rest is the round trip: the dispatch to the worker and, overwhelmingly,
 * the wait for the browser thread to come back and collect (7.9ms mean across
 * all jobs). Audio was refusing video submissions 1,474 times to video's own
 * 314, and still delivering 26 blocks a second where 43 are needed. The work
 * is not the problem; the number of round trips is.
 *
 * Two halves the round trips. It does not reduce the AAC firmware work at all
 * -- two access units cost two decodes wherever they run -- so the win is
 * bounded by the overhead share, which is the honest reason not to reach for
 * a larger number and call it a bigger win.

 * clamped exactly as they are with the knob off, so `boot4` changes one

 *
 * - `edram-real` calls the firmware's own sceAudiocodecGetEDRAM/ReleaseEDRAM
 *   pair for the AAC work buffer. The default is PMPlayer's substitute, which
 *   never calls either: cooleyesAudiocodecGetEDRAM allocates Buffer[4] bytes
 *   of ordinary 64-aligned storage and writes the pointer into Buffer[3].
 *   PMPlayer is the hardware-proven implementation and it bypasses the real
 *   grant deliberately, so the grant is the suspect, not the substitute.
 * - `no-boot` restores the assumption that the Media Engine is already
 *   running program type 3 when the process starts, so a first open that
 *   selects type 3 makes no sceMeBootStart call at all. The default makes one
 *   real call per process for whatever type the policy chose, because
 *   PMPlayer only ever short-circuits type 3 AFTER a real boot call has
 *   succeeded -- an assumption Tilefinch never earned.

 *              the DMA staging copy, a graphics-engine draw sampling the
 *              surface directly, the software scaler, the seek-preview copy
 *              and the staging re-copy after a failed join -- because they are

 *
 * When READING ends is a property of the PATH, not of the moment, and getting

 * branch entirely when the identity has not moved -- so after the copy is
 * joined nothing will ever read the slot again. Holding it longer bought
 * nothing and cost the rate: with the release deferred to the next claim, one
 * slot was freed per claim, so conversions could not outrun claims and the
 * pipeline ran at browser-frame rate rather than at the stream's.
 *
 * On the UNSTAGED paths -- the graphics-engine draw that samples the surface
 * directly, the software scaler, the seek-preview copy -- it still ends at the

 * took whenever no newer picture is due, so a slot freed at the reader's
 * release could be converted into while a re-present still pointed at it:
 * not a tear, but the successor displayed under the claimed picture's
 * identity and timestamp, which is the silent substitution this design is

 * Pictures at the head of a batch that belong to where the stream used to be,

 *
 * Modes 0 and 1 hand firmware a flush or a new object, so nothing survives the
 * reposition and every picture that arrives afterwards belongs to the new
 * position. Mode 2 deliberately tells firmware nothing, which means the Media
 * Engine's reorder pipeline is still holding whatever it had not released --
 * the device log shows output arriving in batches of two and three, so units
 * in between are being held. Those pictures come out after the reposition.
 *
 * Our own queues are cleared, because a pre-seek timestamp must never pair
 * with a post-seek picture. That leaves the opposite hazard, and it is the one
 * that would end the run rather than blemish it: psp_media_output_batch_admitted
 * requires one retained timestamp per picture, so a batch of three arriving
 * against the single timestamp the first post-reposition access unit pushed is
 * refused outright and the session fails with "invalid picture batch". The
 * experiment would then measure the admission rule instead of the wedge.
 *
 * So while the drain window is open, a batch bigger than the timestamps held
 * is read as "the excess is stale" and those pictures are skipped rather than
 * presented. They are at the head because a batch is in output order and the
 * held pictures are the older ones. The window is bounded by the timestamp
 * queue, which is already this decoder's stated bound on supported reorder
 * depth, so a decoder that never returns to a paired batch cannot keep
 * skipping forever.
 *
 * What this does not fix, and does not pretend to: a single held picture that
 * fits inside the timestamps already queued is paired with the earliest of
 * them, so it is presented as one frame of pre-seek content and every later
 * picture is shifted by one entry. That is a bounded A/V skew of a few tens of
 * milliseconds, not a failure. PMPlayer avoids it by never clearing its
 * timestamp queue at all, letting held pictures pair with their own old
 * timestamps; we cannot copy that directly, because our presentation clock
 * re-anchors to a decoded picture's timestamp and a pre-seek timestamp would
 * drag the clock back across the seek.
